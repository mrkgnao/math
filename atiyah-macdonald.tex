\begin{block*}
  Show that the localization of a ring $R$ at a prime ideal $\fr p$ is a local
  ring. What is the maximal ideal?
\end{block*}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
  I claim that the unique maximal ideal is the ideal of nonunits of $R_{\fr p}$,
  more usually defined as
  \[
    \fr m = \{\frac a b : \text{some element of } \fr p \text { divides } a\}
  \]
  For any other ideal $\fr i$, there are two options:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item It contains only nonunits. Then obviously $\fr i \subset \fr m$.
    \item It contains some element that is a unit. Since ideals are closed under
      multiplication, multiply by the inverse of the unit to get a $1$ in the
      ideal, implying that $\fr i = (1)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Hence all proper ideals are contained in $\fr m$.
\end{proof}

\section{Nilradical and Jacobson radical}
Define the \textit{nilradical} of a ring $R$ as \[N_R:=\sqrt{(0)_R}\]
equivalently, $N(R)$ is the ``ideal of nilpotents''. The main use of the
nilradical of a ring (as far as I know!) is to eliminate the problems associated
with nilpotents by looking at $R/N_R$ instead of $R$: it seems plausible (at
least intuitively) that this ring has none.

\begin{block}
  $N_R$ is an ideal.
\end{block}
\begin{proof}
  Closure under $R$-multiplication is clear. As for additive closure, consider
  $x,y\in N_R$, such that $x^m = y^n = 0$. We must show that $x+y$ is also a
  nilpotent.\par
  Consider $(x+y)^{m+n-1}$. Every term of the binomial expansion contains either
  a power of $x^{r\geq m}$ or $y^{s\geq n}$ (else $r+s<m+n-1$), so the entire thing is zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{block}
  $R/N_R$ has no nonzero nilpotents.
\end{block}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\bar x$ is a nilpotent in $R/N_R$, with ${\bar x}^n=0$. Then $x^n$ is
  a nilpotent in $R$ and is mapped to $(0)\in R/N_R$, implying that $\bar x = 0$. 
\end{proof}
