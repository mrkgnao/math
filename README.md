# What's this?
Some notes I write up to understand stuff better, as well as solutions to exercises in books I'm studying or have studied.

# *What*, exactly?
Currently, here's what I have:
* Algebra
  * Artin, *Algebra*
    
    At the moment, there are only a few problems from ch. 11, "Rings".

  * Atiyah-Macdonald, *Introduction to Commutative Algebra*
  
    I just started The One True Commutative Algebra Book and plan to do it very slowly and thoroughly. Might take a while!

* Algebraic geometry
  * Fulton, *Algebraic Curves* ([legal pdf](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf) of the book)
  
    Almost done with ch. 1. There are a lot of theorems from the book I wrote up as well in the pdf.

# What about licenses?
I couldn't care less. CC, attribute me, share-alike, I don't own the books, etc.
