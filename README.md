# What?
Some notes I write up to understand stuff better, as well as solutions to exercises in books I'm studying or have studied.

# *What*, exactly?
Currently, here's what I have:
* Artin, *Algebra*
  At the moment, there are only a few problems from ch. 11, "Rings".
* Fulton, *Algebraic Curves* ([legal pdf](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf) of the book)
  Almost done with ch. 1. there are a lot of theorems from the book I wrote up as well in the pdf.
* Atiyah-Macdonald, *Introduction to Commutative Algebra*
  I just started the One True Commutative Algebra book and plan to do it very slowly and thoroughly. Might take a while!
  
# What about licenses?
I couldn't care less. CC, attribute me, share-alike, I don't own the books, etc.
